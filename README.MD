# Installation
I am new to Java so have not made a Jar yet, and this way you 
can read the source code. 

1. If BlueJ is installed in a custom folder, navigate to the folder
	and click the directory path. Copy the full directory path
2. Right click on compiler.bat and run it.
3. In the terminal window follow the prompts. Right click will paste 
	the directory path.

# Running
1. Run BlueJ.bat
2. At the prompt, respond with your preference.
3. BlueJ will start automatically.
